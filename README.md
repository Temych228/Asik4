This project contains an implementation of a weighted graph using Vertex objects instead of separate Edge objects.
It also includes two graph traversal algorithms: Breadth-First Search and Dijkstra–∏ Algorithm.
The BFS and Dijkstra algorithms are implemented to work directly with this new structure.
BFS explores the graph level by level, while Dijkstra finds the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices using weights.
